# Vesk's C++ Testing Toolkit
A simple testing toolkit to help you test your c++ console application.
## Basic instructions
1. Get the inputs and the correct ouputs for the problem
2. Add the necessary code to your program
3. Run your programs to get your outputs
4. Run the comparator program to compare your outputs to the correct outputs
### Get the inputs and the correct outputs for your problem
### Add the necessary code to your program
### Run your program to get your outputs
### Run the comparator program to compare your outputs to the correct outputs
Once you've got your outputs and the correct outputs in the same folder as the camparator, run the comparator. It will ask you for the name of the problem, because it needs it for the names of the tests, then you'll be asked for the number of tests. And finally for the number of digits in the name of the tests. The program will add zeros to the number of the test until it reaches that number of tests. For example if you are at test 5 and you set 2 digits the number will become 05, if the test was 11 the number will stay 11.
